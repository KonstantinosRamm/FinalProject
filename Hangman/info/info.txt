Hangman is a delightful and challenging game where you test your wits by guessing a hidden word. 
The twist? You have no idea what the word is, and each incorrect guess brings you one step closer 
to being "hanged." Make too many mistakes, and you lose the game. But fear not, with clever guesses
and a bit of luck, you can emerge victorious!

Important Note: This game is designed for use on a Linux terminal. As it leverages certain 
Linux-specific system calls,it may not function correctly on Windows or macOS systems.

The game itself may seem simple, but the underlying complexity focuses heavily on user input validation 
and providing an exceptional user experience. Here's what sets this Hangman game apart:

* Preventing Repeated Guesses:
If you try to insert a character that has already been guessed, it won't affect your progress or bring you 
closer to being hanged.

* Multiple Character Inputs:
You can input multiple characters at once. Each correct guess brings you closer to solving the word, but be
carefulâ€”incorrect guesses will move you closer to the hanger.

* Robust Input Validation:
The game ensures that any attempts to abuse the input prompts are handled gracefully, maintaining the integrity
 of the game experience.
